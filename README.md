- Influencer Reel Pricing Analysis: EDA, linear regression, and random forest modeling with hyperparameter tuning to benchmark and predict Instagram reel prices based on CPM/CPV, follower tiers, engagement, and credibility

## 📌 **Project Description**
This project focuses on predicting Instagram influencer Reel prices using statistical benchmarks and machine learning models. By analyzing audience metrics, engagement, reach, and credibility, the study provides actionable pricing insights and helps marketers and agencies estimate fair compensation for influencer Reels.

## 🛠 **Tools**
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Excel (`openpyxl`)

## 🔍 **Business Case**

* What metrics drive influencer Reel pricing?
* How can expected reach or views be used to estimate price?
* Which machine learning models provide the most reliable predictions?

## 📊 **Results**

* **Linear Regression**: baseline predictions, low R² (~0.29) due to non-linear pricing
* **Random Forest Regression**: better performance, captures complex relationships
* Key Factors: follower count, reach, engagement rate, audience credibility
* Price Benchmarks: CPM (per 1,000 reach) & CPV (per 1,000 views)

## 🚀 **Business Impact**

* Estimate influencer compensation more accurately
* Identify pricing trends across follower tiers
* Support data-driven negotiation and campaign planning

## 📁 **Data**
* internal data (Excel, anonymized)
